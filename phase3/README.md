python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate
```

**2. Step 2**:

Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Step 3**:

Run the script
```bash
python manuscript_model.py
```

**4. Step 4**:

When prompted, enter path to the manuscript text file.
Relative paths are allowed, here are the included ones in `manuscripts/` to use for example:
